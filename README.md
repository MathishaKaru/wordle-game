# Wordle

This game was created with a partner in my Programming Abstractions and Methodologies class at The University of San Diego. It uses the Python GUI toolkit Tkinter. 

The game works like the well-known Worlde game, with a few extra features, such as the ability to use your own word as the answer.
Note that instead of having a rotating list of words every day, this game uses a list of words and randomly selects one for each round of the game.
