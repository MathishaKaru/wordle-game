# Wordle

This game was created with a partner in my Programming Abstractions and Methodologies class at The University of San Diego. It uses the Python GUI toolkit Tkinter. 

The game works like the well-known Worlde game, where a user guesses 5 letter words and uses the colors on each letter to determine how close their guess was (Green = Correct letter in correct location. Orange = Correct letter in wrong location. Gray = Letter not in word).

This game has a few extra features, such as the ability to use your own word as the answer.

Note that instead of having a rotating list of words every day, this game uses a list of words and randomly selects one for each round of the game.
